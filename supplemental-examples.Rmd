## Benthic Multivariate analysis 

Below we provide an example of a readme.md file. This analysis asks how coral reef communities are impacted by pollution. The data was collected with diver surveys who identified different categories of benthic cover along standardized transects [@brown2018]. 

To implement this analysis we would use an AI assitant like github copilot. Then we'd simply place the `readme.md` in an appropriate directory and prompt

```
Do this analysis @readme.md
```

Then we'd review the LLM's decisions as it went and redirect when neccessary. 

The readme file is below. Note that this file is completly self-contained and the workflow can be easily replicated, as the data are available via weblinks.

# Benthic Cover Analysis with Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)

## Introduction
This project analyzes benthic cover surveys to visualize patterns in ecological communities across different sites. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) will be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and reveal underlying patterns in site dispersion. We are particularly interested in how community structure relates to distance to logging. 
Our hypothesis is that sedimentation caused by logging has impact coral cover. 

## Aims

1. Visualize patterns in benthic cover composition across sites
2. Identify potential groupings of sites based on benthic cover composition
3. Relate ecological communities to logging

## Data methodology

The data was collected with the point intersect transect method. Divers swam along transects. There were several transects per site.  Along each transect they dropped points and recorded the type of benthic organism (in categories) on that point. Percentage cover for one organism type can then be calculated as the number of points with that organism divided by the total number of points on that transect.
Transects should be averaged to give a single value for each site. 

This data and study method is a simplified version of the study
[Brown, Hamilton. 2018. Estimating the footprint of pollution on coral reefs with models of species turnover. Conservation Biology. DOI: 10.1111/cobi.13079](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.13079/abstract), which should be cited. 

## Analysis methodology 

We'll use non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) to represent patterns in community structure across sites. Site dispersion will be visualized with a 2D ordination. Be sure to show the 'stress' statistic on the figure, this is critical for interpretation. The nMDS will be created twice using two distance measures: Euclidean distance and Bray-Curtis distance. 
We'll test for relationships among community structure and distance to logging using the `envfit()` algorithm from the `vegan` package. 


## Tech context
- We will use the R program
- tidyverse packages for data manipulation
- vegan package for community analysis
- ggplot2 for data visualization

Keep your scripts short and modular to facilitate debugging. Don't complete all of the steps below in one script. Finish scripts where it makes sense and save intermediate datasets. 

## Steps
As you go tick of the steps below. 

[ ]  Import the datasets
[ ] Wrangle data to make a combined dataset
[ ] Calculate dissimilarity matrices based on benthic cover composition. Here we will use Euclidean and Bray-Curtis distances
[ ] Perform nMDS analysis to visualize site dispersion in ordination space
[ ] Identify ecological patterns and potential groupings of sites
[ ] Assess the stress value to determine the reliability of the nMDS representation
[ ] Explore how ecological communities relate to distance to logging
[ ] Use your vision capabilities to interpret figures
[ ] Write an Rmd report summarizing the findings

As you go, document the methodology. Be sure to output both figures (as png files) and numbers that can be used in the final report.
